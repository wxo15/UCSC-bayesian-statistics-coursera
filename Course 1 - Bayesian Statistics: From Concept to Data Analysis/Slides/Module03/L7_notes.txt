Use a beta prior to inject effective sample size and mean to the Binomial likelihood. 

For prior Beta(alpha, beta):
effective sample size = alpha + beta
mean = alpha / (alpha + beta)

Posterior = Beta(alpha + sum(y), beta + n - sum(y))
New effective sample size = alpha + beta + n
New mean = (alpha + sum(y))/ (alpha + beta + n) = weighted mean of prior and new sample.

Allow sequential update using new values, and would be the same result as having all the samples at once!


If want a uniform prior, can act like prior is Beta(1,1), so posterior becomes Beta(sum(y) + 1, 1 + n - sum(y))

If want prior with very small prior effect, can use Beta(0,0), but it would be improper prior
