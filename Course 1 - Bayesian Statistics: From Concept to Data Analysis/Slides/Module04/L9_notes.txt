Use a gamma prior to inject effective sample size and mean to the Exponential likelihood. 

For prior Gamma(alpha, beta):
mean = alpha / beta
effective size = beta

Posterior = Gamma(alpha + n, beta + sum(y))
effective size = beta + y
New mean = (alpha + 1)/ (beta + y) = weighted mean of prior and new sample. New data point worth "y" sample with the mean of 1/y.
