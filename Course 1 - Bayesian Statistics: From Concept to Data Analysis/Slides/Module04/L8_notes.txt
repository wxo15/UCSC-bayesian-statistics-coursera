Use a gamma prior to inject effective sample size and mean to the Exponential likelihood. 

For prior Gamma(alpha, beta):
mean = alpha / beta
effective number of interval = alpha

Posterior = Gamma(alpha + n, beta + sum(y))
effective number of interval = alpha + n
New mean = (alpha + 1)/ (beta + y) = weighted mean of prior and new sample.
